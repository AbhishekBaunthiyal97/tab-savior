I am excited to announce the launch of my new Chrome extension, Sync Tab Elite. This tool allows users to effortlessly save their current tabs while working in their browser, as well as import and export these tabs for future access. I would like to share a post on LinkedIn highlighting the features of this extension. Additionally, I want to emphasize that I developed this project with the assistance of Cursor AI, without any prior knowledge of development or coding languages. This experience showcases the incredible potential of AI-driven integrated development environments like Cursor AI, enabling anyone to create and deploy applications. I aim to craft an engaging post that will capture the attention of the LinkedIn community.

So the application which is made by me is just a proof of concept; you can consider it as a dummy application which is not production ready so I just made this application to get to know the capabilities of cursor AI and truly, it nailed it so I just want to make a LinkedIn post in like that way.

ðŸš€ Introducing Sync Tab Elite â€“ My First App, Built with AI!

Hey LinkedIn community! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m thrilled to share a project Iâ€™ve been working on: Sync Tab Elite, a Chrome extension designed to simplify browser tab management. If youâ€™ve ever drowned in a sea of open tabs, this is for you. With Sync Tab Elite, you can:

Save all your current tabs with one click.
Import and export them for future use.
Stay organized and keep your browsing stress-free.


What makes this project truly unique? I had zero application development experience before thisâ€”absolutely none! So how did I pull it off? I used Cursor AI, a game-changing AI-powered tool. I didnâ€™t get step-by-step guidance; instead, I provided a Product Requirements Document (PRD) and detailed instructionsâ€”put together with some help from Grok AIâ€”and Cursor AI did it all. It took my ideas and turned them into a fully functional extension.

After a lot of tweaks and changes, Sync Tab Elite is finally ready to use (though itâ€™s still just a proof of concept). This experience has shown me how AI can open up app development to anyone, no coding background required.

Iâ€™d love for you to give Sync Tab Elite a spin and let me know what you think! Got ideas to make it better? Spot something I should tweak? Iâ€™m eager to hear your feedback as I dive deeper into this creative journey. ðŸ’¬
